`Mizuame` is a note-taking app you can open instantly from your Mac’s menu bar.  
It lets you handle quick, throwaway memos and simple calculations with ease.  

However, this app is NOT a high performance note app so that you should use other better apps to save your important data.

# Pros and Cons
### Good
- You can open it instantly from the menu bar icon or with a shortcut, letting you quickly read and write information.
- It can serve as a temporary clipboard, complementing your work in other robust note apps.
- Just by writing a simple formula, it calculates automatically.
- Mizuame supports some Markdown syntax.
  - This means that there are supported syntax elements as well as unsupported ones.

### NOT Good
- You cannot sync data with other devices. (e.g. Mac, iPhone nad iPad)
- This app cannot backup your data(e.g. iCloud), so that your data may be lost unintentionally due to device failure.
- You cannot paste images and movies.
