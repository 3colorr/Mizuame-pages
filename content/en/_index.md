This app is a note on menu bar of Mac.  

What do you do when you want to store a text for a moment that you don't mind losing later?
In this case, `Mizuame` may assist you.

However, this app is NOT a high performance note app so that you should use other better apps to save your important data.

# Pros and Cons
### Good
- You can access it directly from the menu bar, allowing you to read and write information quickly.
- It can serve as a temporary clipboard, complementing your work in other robust note apps.
- Just by writing a simple formula, it calculates automatically.
- Mizuame supports some Markdown syntax.
  - This means that there are supported syntax elements as well as unsupported ones.

### NOT Good
- You cannot sync data with other devices. (e.g. Mac, iPhone nad iPad)
- This app cannot backup your data(e.g. iCloud), so that your data may be lost unintentionally due to device failure.
- You cannot paste images and movies.
