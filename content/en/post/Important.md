# Notice of App Discontinuation

We sincerely apologize for the short notice, but as of **December 30, 2025**, we will discontinue distribution of the “Mizuame” app and end all feature availability.  

While we have maintained the app as an individual project up to now, we have determined that continuing development is no longer feasible, as it will be difficult to secure sufficient time for ongoing work.  

If you have any data in “Mizuame” that you need, please transfer it to another app or service by the end date, and then **uninstall “Mizuame”** once the transfer is complete.  

Please note that after the end date, we will provide a period during which only data export will be available, until **January 14, 2026**. After this period ends, data export will no longer be possible either.  

We will continue to make the source code for “Mizuame” available on GitHub.  

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and kindly ask for your understanding.
