# New Release
We released Mizuame v1.3.1!  

And we released the Mizuame on the AppStore.

## New Features
- You can open the Mizuame by keyboard shortcuts.
  - To use the shortcut key, please add Mizuame to `[Settings] > [Privacy & Security] > [Accessibility]` and grant it accessibility permissions. Then, please restart Mizuame.
  - If you grant Mizuame accessibility permissions, it can detect whether keys are pressed. However, Mizuame never stores history of key inputs, nor does it transmit them over the network.

For more information about the keyboard shortcut, see also...[Features]({{< ref "/features" >}})

By default, these features are disabled. If you want to use them, please enable them in the General tab of the settings.

## Improvement
- We modified the initial launch flow so that users choose a font size first, before moving on to the Terms of Service and other steps.

## Bugfix
- Fixed a bug where changing the note’s line spacing wouldn’t affect the line spacing in the Markdown view.

## Others
- Nothing.
