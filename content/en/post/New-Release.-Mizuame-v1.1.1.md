### New Release
We released Mizuame v1.1.1!  

And we released the Mizuame on the AppStore.  
You can find it by Search for "Mizuame".  

#### Improvement
- Compatible with macOS 14 (Sonoma)

#### Bugfix
- Nothing

#### Others
- Removed "Settings" from the context menu that opens when you right-click an icon in the menu bar. We decided that "Settings"  was not necessary because you can also open "Settings" from the note.
